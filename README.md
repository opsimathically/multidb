# Multidb Library

This is not intended for use by every person, in every case. It is designed for me, in my use cases. If you have similar use cases, it could be useful to you, but I'd prefer you use your own code for your own cases. I do things that could be seen as strange, embedding data in places, collections or otherwise, that only makes sense for tools that I've personally developed. If you use this code you may find things in places you don't expect or need.

The intent of this code is to take code that I use for database purposes, within my own tool libraries and standardize them into a single library which can be imported and easily used for the development and integration of new tools or packages I'm developing.

## Install

```bash
npm install @opsimathically/multidb
```

## Building from source

This package is intended to be run via npm, but if you'd like to build from source,
clone this repo, enter directory, and run `npm install` for dev dependencies, then run
`npm run build`.
